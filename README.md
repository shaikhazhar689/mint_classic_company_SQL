### Stakeholder Needs
Our stakeholders required insights on various aspects of the Mint Classic Company, including:

***Employee and Customer Relations***: The need to list all employees with one or more associated customers from the employees and customers tables. Additionally, they wanted to identify customers with one or more orders in the orders table and view customer-order relationships, even if some customers had no orders.

***Inventory Management***: In this section, I created a temporary table called 'itemcount' using the WITH clause to facilitate the selection of relevant information. & This was likely related to managing inventory levels.
