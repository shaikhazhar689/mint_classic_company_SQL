### Project Overview
Welcome to the Mint Classics Company project, where you'll step into the world of a renowned retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles. In this project, we delve into the domain of employee and customer relations, full join analysis, order value trends, customer value analysis, and product buy price insights. Your journey will also include a close examination of inventory management and product quantity across various warehouses. The project aims to provide actionable insights into these areas of the business.

### Your Challenge:
Your primary challenge is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the Mint Classics Company's data to derive meaningful insights. By utilizing SQL queries, you will address the objectives outlined above, enabling the company to make informed decisions regarding employee-customer relationships, order values, customer value, product buy prices, and inventory management. Your findings will provide actionable recommendations that contribute to the company's overall success and customer satisfaction.

### Data Source:
The project relies on a relational database containing various tables, including employees, customers, orders, products, and warehouses. Your analysis will be based on this data, and the insights you uncover will guide the company's strategic decisions in the areas of inventory management and customer service.

### Stakeholders Needs
Our stakeholders required insights on various aspects of the Mint Classic Company, including:

***Employee and Customer Relations***: The need to list all employees with one or more associated customers from the employees and customers tables. Additionally, they wanted to identify customers with one or more orders in the orders table and view customer-order relationships, even if some customers had no orders.
