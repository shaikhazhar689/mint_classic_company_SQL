### Task
This GitHub project showcases my comprehensive analysis of the Mint Classic Company's operations, focusing on customer data, inventory management, and shipping logistics in the domain of car spare parts. I've employed MySQL Server and extensive SQL queries to address key objectives.

### Stakeholder Needs
Our stakeholders required insights on various aspects of the Mint Classic Company, including:

***Employee and Customer Relations***: The need to list all employees with one or more associated customers from the employees and customers tables. Additionally, they wanted to identify customers with one or more orders in the orders table and view customer-order relationships, even if some customers had no orders.

***Full Join Analysis***: Stakeholders wanted to explore the relationships between employees and customers fully. This involved matching employee names with their customers, highlighting employees without customers, and customers without an associated employee.

***Order Value Trends***: There was a requirement to determine the total order values for each year, specifically for orders that had been shipped.

***Customer Value Analysis***: To identify customers with an average order value exceeding $3,800 for orders that have been shipped.

***Product Buy Price Insights***: We needed to select products with buy prices greater than the average buy price for their respective product lines.

***Inventory Management***: In this section, I created a temporary table called 'itemcount' using the WITH clause to facilitate the selection of relevant information. This was likely related to managing inventory levels.
